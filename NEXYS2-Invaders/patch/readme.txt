The patch files add game fixes to audio and display. Sound effects are closer to original and VGA display orientation is corrected. Add the files in the patch source folder to the game project source folder replacing any existing files. Remove dblscan.vhd from the project source folder as VGA_Invert.vhd replaces that file. Add u_invert.ngc to the main project root folder or wherever invaders.xise is located and compile. Also included is an updated invaders.xise project file (ISE version 14.7) if needed (use is optional).
